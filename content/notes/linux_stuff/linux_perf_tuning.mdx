# Random Linux performance analysis and tuning notes

Time the syscalls:

```
strace -c
```

Sizes and utilization of kernel caches, to see which might need raising limits:

```
slabtop -o -s -c
```

*Steal in `atop` is bad*

Major page fault counters per process:

```
ps -e -o maj_flt,comm | sort -n | tail
```
