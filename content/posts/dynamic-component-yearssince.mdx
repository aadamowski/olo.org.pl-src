As I mentioned in the <Navlink to="/blog/new-website" text="previous blog post"/>,
this website is based on the GatsbyJS static website generation framework.

Itself based on [React](https://reactjs.org), it gave me the opportunity to look at
the technology built and promoted by my employer (Facebook) in a new light.

It's one thing to occasionally work on the presentation layer of internal Facebook
services, spending most of that time modifying parts of larger systems already built
by hundreds of other fellow engineers, and completely another thing to build a new
user interface that's a complete, self-contained website, from scratch.

I learned to appreciate the ability to semantically define certain elements
to express page structure in more meaningful terms than raw HTML elements like `H1`, `P`,
`DIV` or `SPAN`. This gives me some strong [semantic web](https://www.w3.org/standards/semanticweb/)
vibes (for those who still remember that concept) - but with just the really useful parts
(semantic model of the document for my own internal consumption and understanding) without
the parts that made the concept unworkable (the complexity of cross-system integration).

One of the cool things that are possible thanks to basing my website on GatsbyJS is
the ability to support dynamic [React](https://reactjs.org) content thanks to
[hydration](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/conceptual/react-hydration/).

One place where I take advantage of that is my <Navlink to="/resume" text="resume"/> page:
the latest listed position I held has a dynamically calculated duration, expressed in years.

Currently, it shows that I have worked as a Production Engineer at Facebook
for <YearsSince startDate="2016-03-01T09:00:00-07:00" /> years, but on the next
March 1st at 9:00 Pacific Time it will automatically flip
to <YearsSince startDate="2015-03-01T09:00:00-07:00" /> years - without you
having to reload the web page. If you have the patience, feel free to verify that
by visiting my page on the relevant date!

This is a small, barely noticeable gimmick, but it was fun to implement
and has been a nice learning experience.

The implementation is pretty straightforward: first, I created a React component that
I named [`yearssince`](https://github.com/aadamowski/olo.org.pl-src/blob/main/src/components/yearssince.js).

It tracks its internal state in two regular JavaScript `Date` objects - the start date and the current date timestamp.

Then it sets up a timer with an interval of one second that changes the
internal state by replacing the current date with a fresh one.

At rendering phase, it uses the `moment` JS library (a base dependency of Gatsby)
to calculate a timezone and Gregorian calendar-conscious difference in years
between the start date and the present.

When [embedded](https://github.com/aadamowski/olo.org.pl-src/blob/a7555fa60338ee861cc802e08da87869bc99bb68/src/pages/resume.js#L75)
in a page, Gatsby automatically hydrates this component - so even when all of the content
of the website gets pre-rendered on build time, the particular elements generated
by this component will keep getting updated by React DOM server automatically
within the web browser.

The result is a counter of elapsed years that is always right.
